<font color ="black">Career & Technical Education</font>

"Today's economy demands a better educated workforce more than ever before.  Career and Technical Education (CTE) is an elective program and an integral part of Apex Friendship High School.  CTE provides students with the academic rigor, technical knowledge, employability skills, and real-world experiences needed to pursue postsecondary training and higher education for high-skill, high-demand, and highly successful careers.

CTE brings education and business together so that students gain real world understanding of their skills and are equipped for career success. Nearly all CTE educators report working with business and industry leaders in their programs in a range of capacities, from advisory panels to classroom visits to offering internships and job shadowing opportunities to students. The business community helps validate the CTE curriculum and donates supplies and equipment. This relationship helps educators ground their curriculums in the real needs of real businesses, leading students to obtain skills that will be highly valuable in the job market."

This group of students also gets opportunities to go on educational field trips, job shadow, and learn from the best in our state.
